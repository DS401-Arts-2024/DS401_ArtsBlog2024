Here's my attempt at drawing a smiley face.

```{r}
# Create a blank plot
plot(1, type="n", xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10), axes=FALSE, xlab="", ylab="", main="Smiley Face")

# Draw the face (circle)
symbols(5, 5, circles=5, add=TRUE, inches=0.5)

# Draw the eyes (circles)
symbols(3.5, 6, circles=0.5, inches=0.2, add=TRUE)
symbols(6.5, 6, circles=0.5, inches=0.2, add=TRUE)

# Draw the mouth (arc)
curve(5 + 1.5 * sin(x), from=pi/6, to=5*pi/6, add=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2)

```
