I believe the most important part of any society is how people treat each other; our relationships and our complex web of interactions are the foundation of our communities. It's easy to overlook this nowadays, because we are connected less in person and more digitally which is of course less personal.

Quantifying the depth and significance of these relationships is challenging. While economic indicators like GDP and the Gini index provide a numerical snapshot of society, they fall short in capturing the nuances of human connection.

As Americans, we're steeped in a capitalistic worldview, which understandably influences our perception of the world. While economic success is important, reducing society to mere numbers overlooks the richness of human experience. This obsession with quantification has led to unprecedented economic growth but has also left us yearning for a deeper understanding of our collective well-being.

I want to do this project because I would rather gain insights into a communities overall picture of well-being/quality of life, then to just get economic rankings which has been done plenty by many.

One of my favorite works of art is the the flatiron, honestly I don't exactly why I like it except that it really just seems like the flatiron building is in perfect positioning. ![Steichen Flatiron](imgs/Steichen_flatiron.jpg)

I use to dabble in photography. ![personal](imgs/IMG_4820.jpg)
